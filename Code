-- Section 1: Uniform Search

-- 6 x 6 grid search states

-- The Node type defines the position of the robot on the grid.
-- The Branch type synonym defines the branch of search through the grid.

type Node = (Int,Int)
type Branch = [(Int,Int)]

badNodesList::[Node]
-- This is your list of bad nodes. You should experiment with it to make sure your algorithm covers different cases.
badNodesList = []

-- The maximum depth this search can reach
-- TODO: Fill in the maximum depth and justify your choice
maxDepth::Int
maxDepth= gridLength_search * gridWidth_search - length badNodesList;
-- Why did you choose this number?
-- This is the number of free squares and it is the upper bound for maxdepth


-- The next function should return all the possible continuations of input search branch through the grid.
-- Remember that the robot can only move up, down, left and right, and can't move outside the grid.
-- The current location of the robot is the head of the input branch.
-- Your function should return an empty list if the input search branch is empty.
-- This implementation of next function does not backtrace branches.

next::Branch -> [Branch]
next [] =  []
next branch@((x,y):xs) = filter (not.null) (verify (x+1,y) branch : verify (x-1,y) branch : verify (x,y+1) branch : [verify (x,y-1) branch])

-- |The checkArrival function should return true if the current location of the robot is the destination, and false otherwise.
 -- Note that this is the right type declaration for this function. You might have an old version of the Assignment PDF that names this wrongly.
checkArrival::Node -> Node -> Bool
checkArrival destination curNode = destination == curNode


-- Section 3 Uniformed Search
-- | Breadth-First Searchc
-- The breadthFirstSearch function should use the next function to expand a node,
-- and the checkArrival function to check whether a node is a destination position.
-- The function should search nodes using a breadth first search order.

-- | Depth-Limited Search
-- The depthLimitedSearch function is similiar to the depthFirstSearch function,

-- | Iterative-deepening search
-- The iterDeepSearch function should initially search nodes using depth-first to depth d,
-- and should increase the depth by 1 if search is unsuccessful.
-- This process should be continued until a solution is found.
-- Each time a solution is not found the depth should be increased.

-- Manhattan distance heuristic
-- This function should return the manhattan distance between the 'position' point and the 'destination'.

manhattan::Node->Node->Int
manhattan position destination = abs((fst position) - (fst destination)) + abs((snd position) - (snd destination))

-- | Best-First Search
-- The bestFirstSearch function uses the checkArrival function to check whether a node is a destination position,
-- and the heuristic function (of type Node->Int) to determine the order in which nodes are searched.
-- Nodes with a lower heuristic value should be searched before nodes with a higher heuristic value.

            | otherwise = LT
          queue =  sortBy priority_sort (next pop_branch ++ init branches)

-- | A* Search
-- The aStarSearch function is similar to the bestFirstSearch function
-- except it includes the cost of getting to the state when determining the value of the node.
